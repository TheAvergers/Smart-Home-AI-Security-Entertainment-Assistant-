Smart Home AI Security/Entertainment Assistant

3. Description of the Project

Problem Statement:

Current smart home options either lack sophistication or rely heavily on expensive subscriptions and hardware setups, resulting in lackluster performances.

Core Features:

Utilize real-time computer vision and generative AI to monitor and analyze video feeds from standard cameras.

Implement AI-driven anomaly detection to automatically identify suspicious behaviors, unfamiliar individuals, and gestures.

Generate instant visual alerts with clearly annotated security events (bounding boxes, event labels).

Provide a security report (either to desktop or mobile device).

Innovation and Impact:

Integrates computer vision and generative AI to significantly enhance smart home functionality.

Reduces false alarms, enhancing trust and practical usage by homeowners.

4. Resources to Use

GitHub repositories for real-time object detection (YOLOv8, Detectron2).

Open-source generative AI models for anomaly detection and event summarization (autoencoder-based anomaly detection frameworks).

Frameworks: OpenCV, TensorFlow or PyTorch for AI model development.

Adapt and build upon class lab exercises on generative AI and computer vision and past CV work.

5. Deliverables

Functional prototype demonstrating real-time alert generation.

Complete GitHub repository containing organized codebase, README, installation guide, and documented AI model implementations.

Performance metrics report highlighting accuracy, detection speed, and reduced false alarms.
